            <p>
              Hello! My name is Ayman Ismail, and I am a 4th Year Software
              Engineering Student at University of Palestine. I enjoy web
              development, particularly frontend technologies, and am highly
              interested in AI and emerging technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
              I began my programming experience with a passion to create
              user-friendly interfaces that solve real-world problems. I always
              endeavor to learn and improve my knowledge and skills in modern
              web frameworks and tools.
            </p>
            <p>
              I enjoy creating clean, responsive, and user-focused websites. My
              most proud accomplishment is my work on the Nexus project (on my
              GitHub), where I demonstrated that I could make usable and
              gorgeous web applications.

        <h2>Why I'm Applying to Code2Careers</h2>
        <div class="why-content">
          <p>
            I am interested in the Code2Careers training program because I
            believe that it is a golden opportunity to transform my passion for
            technology into tangible skills that can be translated into good
            jobs. The real-world skill focus of the program and its
            collaboration with professional Egyptian trainers are exactly what I
            need to take my career to the next level.
          </p>
          <p>
            My aspiration since the commencement of this training is to become a
            more skilled React developer. Against the backdrop of war in Gaza,
            moving forward, learning, and developing best fit my personality:
            turning challenges into inspiration sources. This training presents
            a great opportunity for me to gain hands-on exposure and sharpen my
            competitive edge for the job market through structured study and
            direct interaction with experienced mentors.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am most interested in the
            <strong>Front-End Development (React/Angular)</strong>
            track since I have a passion for developing user interfaces and
            interactive experiences. The opportunity to participate in a group
            project towards the end of the training is also thrilling since it
            will provide me with teamwork experience that is close to real
            working conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Gaza tech community has tremendous potential, and I would be
            excited to play a role in its growth. This program offers the
            technical expertise to shatter the local job obstacles and connect
            with international prospects. I am ready to devote the time and
            energy required by this intensive 6-month program and am excited
            about the prospects it will open up.
